# AhoyKeyboard (Built-in Keyboard Enable/Disable Tool)

## üõ†Ô∏è Overview

AhoyKeyboard is a lightweight WPF application that helps you easily enable or disable the built-in keyboard (especially on laptops) on Windows operating systems. It is useful when you want to prevent malfunction or unnecessary input from the built-in keyboard while using an external keyboard. This application is based on the .NET 9.0 framework and can be conveniently controlled from the system tray icon in the background.

## ‚ú® Main Features

- **Enable/Disable Built-in Keyboard:** Instantly turn your laptop's built-in keyboard on or off with a single click.
- **System Tray Icon:** The application runs in the background and is accessible via a system tray icon for better accessibility.
- **Easy Status Check:** Intuitively check the current keyboard status (enabled/disabled) through the tray icon.
- **Background Operation:** Minimizes to the tray to use minimal system resources.
- **Auto Start (Optional):** Optionally set the application to run automatically at Windows startup. (To be implemented)

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Windows 10 or later
- .NET 9.0 Runtime (If not installed, the application will guide you to download and install it.)
- Administrator privileges (Required to control device drivers)

### Installation (Release Version)

2. Extract the downloaded ZIP file.
3. Run the `AhoyKeyboard.exe` file inside the extracted folder.
   - **Note:** You must run as **Administrator** to control device drivers. Right-click the `AhoyKeyboard.exe` file and select "Run as administrator".

### Building (Development Environment)
